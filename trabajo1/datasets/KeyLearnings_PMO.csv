1918CB93-C1DC-EE11-904D-000D3A5A3338,Betting & Gaming SoS Certificates Tracking & Cascading is critical information.,Best Practice,Tara Braun,"When we found that a separate Company (Entity) needed to be dedicated to the Betting & Gaming programs at Concentrix. This resulted in the need to have Corporate Governance apply to various states to the Security of State to be allowed to do business in the state. This became known as the ""SoS Certificates"". Many states require this information and certification when pursuing a Gaming License. 
Once this was understood, we partnered with our Corporate Governance team to list ALL the US States. Listing all the states quickly became a must have as the SoS Certificate we found was also needed for registering the new Entity for payroll for our active employees' resident states.
Because the SoS Certificate was needed for 2 workstreams it made sense to track all the US states as the SoS could be needed for only Licensing or only Payroll registration, or both. Prioritizing the SoS certificates was essential as the Corporate Governance team needed to determine which state to work on first to register. 
We decided to prioritize the workflow by the client roadmap of state launch dates. Because Massachusetts and Ohio were the first states to go live, these were the priority states, then once Corporate Governance completed sending for the SoS Certificate, they would contact our team to decide what state to move to next. 
Once the key members understood the requirements and who needed the information, the team worked smoothly to send, receive, and cascade the information. The PM was the gatekeeper to cascade the information to the right workstreams that needed the SoS Certificate (such as Regulatory Compliance and/or Payroll) for their next steps.","Adding to Gaming Playbook 

Track each state (or geography) closely. There are many critical tasks and information that need to be completed for various states. No state requires the same information; therefore, no state will need the same task to be completed.

This POC also had insight into any changes in the Fanatics Road Map for when & if states launched dates would change.

We quickly set up internal Licensing meetings to discuss our internal risks, issues, questions, tasks.

A sequential chain of approval that includes managers, supervisors, directors, and so on, is a key source of delay. Considering how busy they are, it is not surprising that management is often a bottleneck. Each of these approvers represents a potential node for delays in the approval process.","Through the work that has been done in the pre-planning stage, the project team will have much more leverage to get the right decisions made and resources and funds dedicated to the project.

The foundation that has been laid will help the project start off in the right direction and progress quickly through planning and into execution.

Experiencing bottlenecks in approvals wastes time and impacts operational efficiency on all levels. For instance, when too much time has been wasted getting approvals, those down the line of operations are pressured into completing tasks to meet up with deadlines.

Understand what details the CNX Executive Leadership team are looking for and plan to meet those expectations. For example, what details do the executive leadership team need to know to expedite project approvals and ensure receipt in a timely manner.

Alternatively, another option to solving these challenges is to implement standardized approval workflows across the organization. Having a software that aids in visualizing workflows and helps streamline the approval process can go a long way in gaining greater control and avoiding mistakes.",,,,53734979-3E7A-ED11-81AD-000D3A31C831,Return to Office (RTO) - Orlando (Building 285),2023-03-30 00:00:00

We found this portal the most useful when Pennsylvania licensing was being done.

We feel the portal would be more beneficial if we had a larger occupational need, by headcount or by states requiring occupational. The portal doesn't submit the application for you, it provides us a place and details of information to input data, then download to send to the state for application. 
There are some states that are not on the portal, but this is a small number.
Leveraging this portal again for any future licensing needs would need to be discussed with leadership and the Licensing Admin team to validate its value based on the scope of licensing needed.","Review what Entity (KEY), and Occupational Licensing requirements are scoped for a program. Leveraging the Compliable portal could be extremely useful for tracking, data entry, state requirements, etc... But if the scope of licensing is minimal, using the portal may not be of value.

It is best to figure out with the Licensing Coordinator if Compliable will be used, and by whom. Include with this what states will require licensing for individuals & what application is to be used as some states will have different applications depending on the outcome of the Scope of Licensing done with the state & our Regulatory Compliance team.

The FBG Licensing contacts were under the same understanding as we were and outside legal counsel, however the communication & connection did not cascade to FBG operational leadership.

Due to this disconnect the FBG Operational team skilled our game-changers for Maryland volume without consulting their or our Licensing teams.

Delays implementing solution.","VDI guidance provided: 
1. Additional rules need to be added to the Azure Network Security Group. The group policies for VDI are more restrictive than the ones for B&M. This results in policies that are set specifically for each browser to prevent logins into certain domains including Google and Microsoft domains.
 
2. Enable ""Automatically re-image used hosts"" configuration option for both Production and Trusted Staff to allow for new fresh VDI host upon login.

If an end-customer doesn’t have a pre-registered credit card or wishes to use a different one, there is no secure payment system in place, necessitating the full credit card details for payment processing. When payments are made using the Wallet, a PIN is required, which the end-customer must provide over the phone. This PIN is static, allowing someone to memorize it and misuse it for payments on other accounts. Additionally, no notifications are sent to clients after their wallet is used.","Secure Payment System: Introduce a secure payment system that does not require full credit card details for each transaction.
Utilize tokenization to replace sensitive card information with a unique identifier.
Enhanced Verification: Implement OTP (One-Time Password) verification before processing payments or any other type of customer confirmation.
Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security for payment processes.
Dynamic PIN Management: Recommend that the PIN be changed regularly to prevent fraud. Implement a dynamic PIN system where the PIN changes after each transaction.
Customer Notifications: Send notifications to clients after their wallet is used to ensure they are aware of all transactions. Provide real-time alerts for any changes or transactions involving their credit card or wallet.
Key Learning: By implementing these mitigation strategies, organizations can significantly enhance the security of credit card payments. This not only protects sensitive financial information but also builds trust with customers by ensuring their transactions are secure.

8A892024-B3DA-EF11-A731-000D3A595F8F,Changes in scope and usage of new tools,Improvement Opportunity,Andres Gomez,"The Avalon project involved the participation of approximately four ITSAs in the solutioning phase, with several changes made to the initial project scope. Cloudflare was selected as the solution to meet the open internet requirement and was later integrated with a VDI, which was not part of the original plan.

Cloudflare was implemented despite only having a proof of concept (POC) from an IT perspective. While the Cloudflare solution was successfully built and deployed during the implementation, there were instances where the team had to rely heavily on the vendor to resolve issues and alerts. Being a relatively new tool and utilized at this scale for the first time within the company, the team faced several challenges related to its usage and configurations. These challenges were addressed during the implementation phase, though they resulted in some delays.","Strengthen Tool Evaluation and Readiness:
Ensure that all tools being implemented, especially at a large scale, are thoroughly evaluated and have completed pilot phases or proof-of-concept (POC) testing before being integrated into critical projects. This reduces reliance on external vendors and ensures smoother deployments.

Develop Comprehensive Training and Documentation:
Provide training for internal IT teams on new tools like Cloudflare, focusing on configurations, troubleshooting, and best practices. Create detailed documentation to support future implementations and minimize dependency on external vendors.

Conduct Scope Validation and Change Control:
Establish a robust process for validating the initial scope and addressing scope changes during the project. Ensure that all adjustments are carefully reviewed and accounted for, particularly for technical dependencies like VDIs or additional integrations.

Enhance Vendor Support Agreements:
Negotiate detailed Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with tool vendors, including faster response times for issue resolution and dedicated support resources for large-scale implementations.

Pilot Large-Scale Implementations:
For new tools like Cloudflare, consider running smaller-scale pilot projects across select locations to identify potential challenges and refine configurations before deploying them company-wide.

Integrate Cross-Functional Collaboration:
Create a centralized team with representatives from key IT functions, such as ITSAs, infrastructure, and operations, to improve coordination and resolve challenges quickly during complex projects.

Establish a Post-Implementation Review:
After deploying new tools at scale, conduct a formal review to document lessons learned, challenges faced, and areas of improvement for future projects. This can help mitigate delays in subsequent implementations.",IT,,Negative,D29C78E5-8A90-EF11-AC21-000D3A5B8A5A,Client Transition - Avalon AIML,2025-01-25 00:00:00

Kick-off externally was started on 10/31/24 internally was started 11/5/24. It should be noted those two weeks would have been crucial to meet our goal as we were just short on hiring.

At this moment we need to start from 0 the process of registration for CO, temporarily I will put an applied for ID status on WD so the game changers can set up their taxes normally, they will not see any affectation on their taxes and all withholdings will be accurate, however all CO wages will be on hold until the registration is completed.

Each state will have different rules for payroll, withholding, and SUI registration. 
Payroll should work with the Project Manager to document each state threshold or requirements to ensure we are being effective in our registration strategy.
The Payroll & Project Manager should decide who will own tracking any exceptions a state may need preventing a state un-registering the Entity.

Example: register Colorado in Q1 as the person who should be working for that Entity starting in Q1. If there are changes to the plan or schedule resulting in the person reporting wages in Q2, the state may un-register the Entity.

No EHO na parte de Reporting no dia 08/03 estava alinhado que os sistemas do cliente já possuiam dashboards internos. Foi considerado um recurso compartilhado para extrair informações manuais do Freshdesk (pois o sistema não tem alimentação automática). Outro ponto destacado foi: """"For Custom reports client must provide the glossary with KPI Name, Definition , Calculation and Datasource location."""" Ou seja, o cliente precisaria entregar um dicionário de Dados e KPIs para criação de relatórios internos.

A comunicação que recebi da área de projetos é que o esperado para o Go live eram 7 relatórios prontos e funcionando, com os dados das ferramentas do cliente e nossos de Avaya.
 Desses com ferramenta do cliente, ele não possuia o cálculo, base de exemplo e/ou requisito de métrica bem definido. Fizemos algumas reuniões e apenas no dia 20/04 fechamos com o cliente as fórmulas e requisitos para os 7 relatórios.
Porém, o contrato pedia o apoio de 25% de um analista compartilhado, ou seja, 2:15 de tempo produtivo nesse cliente por dia.

Um conta para exemplificar, se esse analista fosse capaz de entregar um relatório por dia útil (o que normalmente é impossível devido aos processos de transformação de dados) ele levaria então 7 dias úteis (se fosse dedicado). Como o tempo disponível era de apenas 25% a previsão de entrega dos relatórios seria para 28 dias úteis (30/05).

Vários outros fatores apresentaram problemas, como por exemplo: a não entrega dos skills do avaya, não entrega dos logins de sistema pelo cliente, demora na geração de escala e hierarquia em sistema oficial, mudança de requisito por parte do cliente durante a execução.
Para conseguir entregar os primeiros relatórios ao cliente nós alocamos tempo dedicado de dois coordenadores e um gerente de reporting para Desenvolvimento dos fluxos, processos e relatórios do cliente.

1. MSO365 License Assignment
Ops must explicitly request the assignment of an MSO365 license for all promoted agents.
2. Account Transfer to New OUs
Ensure that user accounts are moved to the respective new account Organizational Units (OUs).
3. Security Group Cleanup
Remove any security groups or permissions associated with the previous account.
By adhering to these steps, we can prevent access issues and ensure proper configuration for the new account.

W0 Training Start - Lessons Learned
During the WIX training start, support staff moved to the account faced issues due to missing MSO365 license requests. This oversight caused several users to lack appropriate licenses and lose access to Outlook, where client credentials were supposed to be received.

As a workaround, WIX assisted by sending credentials to managers, but this created delays and negative impacts, as transfered staff were unable to access their client emails promptly.

Moving forward, all license assignments must be verified during the onboarding process to prevent similar issues.","Mandatory Steps Prior to W0 Training Start or Client Tools Onboarding

To ensure a smooth onboarding process for agents and avoid access issues, the following steps must be completed before W0 training start or client tools onboarding:

1. Workday Updates
People Solutions and Operations must ensure that promotions or transfers are properly coded under the new account MSA Client and Activity ID in Workday.
The current manager must approve the transfer to the new account in Workday.
2. MSO365 License Allocation
The new manager must submit a ticket through SolvNow to request MSO365 license assignment for the transferred user.
3. Account and Security Updates

Request the movement of the user account to the new Organizational Unit (OU).

Issue resulted causing additional routing cleanup since old setup didn't meet Fanatics requirements. The use of existing site VLANS is a process often used for short duration setup windows. However, additional steps need to be cared for to ensure proper network routing to avoid long troubleshooting sessions.","Future projects should avoid using existing site VLANs and then attempt to modify them.

This created a transparent partnership with the POC and opened up many great discussions on how to partner together. People that were regular meeting attendees were always aware of the history of a state's status, but not all leadership are able to attend the regular status meetings.
I found it best to keep a running week of week status of each state status, discussion points, decisions, notes, etc... to be able to easily provide a summary of a situation if it arose to leadership.
Example is with Ohio as it was a lengthy and challenging process, by keeping week over week notations we were able to provide a summary quickly and easily to the client showing our effort and blockers that had to be overcome.  We called this our ""License Snapshot"" which was well received by the client Licensing POC and knew weekly she would receive and update in email every Thursday morning so she could have information for upcoming meetings or decisions she needed to be part of.
It was simple adding a new column to a spreadsheet every week beside a list of states. Simple and effective way to communicate.","Track each state (or geography) closely when seeking licensing for a state, either Entity only or Entity and Occupational. Ensure notes are retained and best to keep in chronological order for easy summarization if an issue does occur.

Although PH has already transitioned from CSVAR to SVAR (with different score points), the distinction between the two was not fully known among the team.

The client raised a concern on this, and the team had to clarify that we just mislabeled the scores. Ms Jenny Rojas also clarifies: As early as the solutioning stage, it was made clear to Sales and Solutions (who also made it clear to All State) that PH is using CSVAR while Latam uses SVAR.
A lot of back and forth on that since actual numerical scores vary despite being on the same CEFR level. The agreement was CSVAR 57 for PH although not stipulated in the SOW.

During UAT testing, it was discovered that a good number of profiles did not get replicated to SolvNow. As it turns out, the root cause was that prior to Workday integration, there was a business need to create CNX active directory records for certain new organization (Webhelp) users. These Active directory profiles were created with missing some key details that allowed the systems needed to work fine, but resulted in the SolvNow profile not correctly reflecting data such as job location, which meant that people solution cases did not get routed correctly. Once there Workday integration was built, there was no contingency plans to cleanup or remove the temporary active directory accounts resulting in incorrect data in SolvNow. This was a very complex issue to handle in the weeks leading up to production. The good news is the IT team, lead by Michael Fernandez, Tapasa Maharana and others, responded very quickly and worked many hours to get most of the data corrected (more than 95% were fixed before go-live).","Consider the following actions if you project is relying on data from Workday/Active Directory:
1) Is there a way to audit to see if there are incomplete records in Active Directory? 2) Include a test scenario where a user had an active directory account before the active directory account was created from the Workday feed. 3) is there a way for the Workday / Active Directory integration process to flag when there are duplicate records?",Active Directory Sync Issue,,Positive,A61F8A20-4CD0-EE11-9079-000D3A5A3338,INT_GLB_SolvNow Transformational Initiatives - WebHelp PS integration,2024-10-08 00:00:00

The industry is growing in many geographies with online gaming & betting. The US leaves online gaming up to each state and is not dictated at the federal level.

As the industry constantly has changes at the state level, it is critical to track any changes in our requirements and tasks. 
With a new market client, it is critical to track changes as we have learned a new market client may be learning what their tasks & requirements are right along with us. This could lead to changes in their launch dates, changes in the scope of work our advisors will do, which could change the scope of licenses needed for us.

Example: the Fanatics Roadmap for launching states started with only a handful of states and month they planned to launch. By the close of project, the total states CNX was asked to support was 21 states which had over 15 changes in launch dates.

This would be part of the state's review to decide our licensing requirements.
We partnered with Fanatics to review their Use Case and expanded to include if any PII was viewable, and/or editable.
A large list of tasks by workstream (Customer Service Advisor, Sr. Advisor, Payments, Fraud) was compiled and reviewed, then handed to Regulatory Compliance to then hand to Duane Morris. From here Duane Morris provided to the states that requested it, but also provided to States we thought it would be useful to get in front of their ask and show transparency.
As a result, many states decided that licensing was not required either at an Occupational Level, or both Occupational and Entity.
By completing this Use Case it was an immense value for efficiently working with various states when they need to determine our scope of licensing.","Adding to Gaming Playbook 

Continue to use a Use Case template or something similar that provides a state regulator transparency into our servicing support. It gives the state a solid picture of our services and how we are partnered with the client.

While this approach was feasible before training commenced, additional testing required during Nesting and Production (Prod) UAT placed significant pressure on the trainer to manage both the UAT and maintain the class schedule.
The core issue arises from inadequate planning for UAT and Production testing, resulting in an over-reliance on a single virtual trainer. This led to increased stress and workload on the trainer, potentially risking the quality of both training and UAT processes.","1. Assess UAT Plan and effort required to complete the tasks, ensuring incorporating worst-case scenario if the tester would be needed due to failure of first test.

Our team designed and presented the desired migration plan to accomplish this in this short window. Cirion executed the migration as per suggested plan and the process was successful and uneventful. Embratel, with client's approval, decided to carry out all stages of the migration on the eve of the go live window despite all the highlighted risks and complexity.  Despite clear communication from CNX end, Embratel's carrier had internalized the migration request only for the address, and not for circuit signaling. And we were left with no time to fix the issue in time. Therefore, the Embratel circuit, responsible for 4 of the 8 numbers received, was not active for Go Live.","1) For projects involving circuit migration, the minimum recommended period to be negotiated for transition should be 90 days, subject to extension.
